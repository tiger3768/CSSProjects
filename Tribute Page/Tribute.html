            <h2>An Exponent of Stoicism</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Epictetus (pronounced Epic-TEE-tus)</b> flourished in the early second
                century C.E. about four hundred years after the Stoic school of Zeno of Citium was established in
                Athens. He lived and worked, first as a student in Rome, and then as a teacher with his own school
                in Nicopolis in Greece. Our knowledge of his philosophy and his method as a teacher comes to us
                via two works composed by his student Arrian, the Discourses and the Handbook. Although Epictetus
                based his teaching on the works of the early Stoics (none of which survives) which dealt with the
                three branches of Stoic thought, logic, physics and ethics, the Discourses and the Handbook
                concentrate almost exclusively on ethics. The role of the Stoic teacher was to encourage his
                students to live the philosophic life, whose end was eudaimonia (‘happiness’ or ‘flourishing’),
                to be secured by living the life of reason, which – for Stoics – meant living virtuously and
                living ‘according to nature’. The eudaimonia (‘happiness’) of those who attain this ideal
                consists of ataraxia (imperturbability), apatheia (freedom from passion), eupatheiai (‘good
                feelings’), and an awareness of, and capacity to attain, what counts as living as a rational
                being should. The key to transforming oneself into the Stoic sophos (wise person) is to learn
                what is ‘in one’s power’, and this is ‘the correct use of impressions’ (phantasiai), which in
                outline involves not judging as good or bad anything that appears to one. For the only thing
                that is good is acting virtuously (that is, motivated by virtue), and the only thing that is bad
                is the opposite, acting viciously (that is, motivated by vice). Someone who seeks to make progress
                as a Stoic (a prokoptôn) understands that their power of rationality is a fragment of God whose
                material body – a sort of rarefied fiery air – blends with the whole of creation, intelligently
                forming and directing undifferentiated matter to make the world as we experience it. The task of
                the prokoptôn, therefore, is to ‘live according to nature’, which means (a) pursuing a course
                through life intelligently responding to one’s own needs and duties as a sociable human being,
                but also (b) wholly accepting one’s fate and the fate of the world as coming directly from the
                divine intelligence which makes the world the best that is possible.
